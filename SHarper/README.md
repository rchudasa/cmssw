Sam Harper's usercode area which has some useful tools for e/gamma. In general anything here super useful will migrate to other repos. 

Its mainly here as it was used to generate the ntuples for the regression so as per E/gamma policy it has to be in the E/gamma area.

## install instructions
it needs to cloned into the directory SHarper in the $CMSSW_BASE/src directory. 

So when reading from Sam's version

```
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
git clone git@github.com:Sam-Harper/usercode.git SHarper
```

or from the cms-egamma repo

```
cd $CMSSW_BASE/src
git clone git@github.com:cms-egamma/SHarper-UserCode.git SHarper
```
